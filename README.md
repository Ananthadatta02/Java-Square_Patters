# Java-Square_Patters
This Java program prints a hollow square star pattern of size n Ã— n. It takes user input (n), then uses nested loops to print * on the first and last rows, and at the start and end of middle rows, with spaces in between. Conditions (i == 0, j == 1, i == n - 1, j == n) determine placement.
